# Coding Guidelines

* Aim to build all functionality using SwiftUI unless there is a feature that is only supported in UIKit.
* Design UI in a way that is idiomatic for the iOS platform and follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines.
* Use SF Symbols for iconography.
* Use the most modern iOS APIs. This app can target the latest iOS version with the newest APIs.
* Use the most modern Swift language features and conventions. Target Swift 6 and use Swift concurrency (async/await, actors) and Swift macros where applicable.
